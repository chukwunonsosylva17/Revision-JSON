The Difference Between a PUT and a PATCH Request;

PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource. It is used to set an entity’s information completely. PUT is similar to POST in that it can create resources, but it does so when there is a defined URI ( URI is the uniform resource identifier of the resource to which the request applies). PUT overwrites the entire entity if it already exists, and creates a new resource if it doesn’t exist.

For example, when you want to change the first name of a person in a database, you need to send the entire resource when making a PUT request.

{“first": "John", "last": "Stone”}
To make a PUT request, you need to send the two parameters; the first and the last name. 

Unlike PUT, PATCH applies a partial update to the resource.

This means that you are only required to send the data that you want to update, and it won’t affect or change anything else. So if you want to update the first name on a database, you will only be required to send the first parameter; the first name.


The main difference between PUT and PATCH requests are in the way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the resource identified by the Request-URI.

In a PUT request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced.

With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version.

Also, another difference is that when you want to update a resource with PUT request, you have to send the full payload as the request whereas with PATCH, is used when you want to apply a partial update to the resource
